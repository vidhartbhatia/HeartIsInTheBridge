# HeartIsInTheBridge
A project to light the Randy Paush Memorial Bridge with heart beats.

The Pausch Bridge was created as both a metaphorical and physical connection between the School of Drama and the School of Computer Science. Regardless of discipline, every Carnegie Mellon student knows the saying, "My Heart is in the Work." In this lighting display, we hope to join the campus by displaying everyone's heartbeat on the bridge. When enough users connect to our heartbeat display, every panel on the bridge will pulse in unison, showcasing the harmony that ensues when we come together for a common purpose.
